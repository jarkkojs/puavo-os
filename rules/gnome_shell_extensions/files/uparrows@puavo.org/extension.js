To demonstrate how this extension works, here's a schematic of the
keyboard layout panel button, with their variable names listed:

    +- _hbox -------------------------------+
    | +- _container -+ +- PopupMenuArrow -+ |
    | |      fi      | |        ▼         | |
    | +--------------+ +------------------+ |
    +---------------------------------------+

Reference:
    gnome-shell/js/ui/keyboard.js, function _init() for class
    InputSourceIndicator, around row 792:

We want to locate the PopupMenuArrow widgets and change their icon
names. That's what this extension does. You could also locate each
arrow element, destroy and recreate it by creating a
PopupMenu.arrowIcon(St.Side.TOP) element. But that's clunky.

The other buttons have similar structures, they just have other number
of child items we have to skip over.

For example, you can access the keyboard layout indicator button arrow
by typing this in Looking Glass:

Main.panel.statusArea.keyboard.actor.get_first_child().get_first_child().get_next_sibling();

function reorientArrows(parent, from, to)

    if (parent.constructor.name === "St_Icon" &&
        parent.style_class === "popup-menu-arrow") {
        if (parent.icon_name == from)
            parent.icon_name = to
    }

    // recurse if there are child elements
    if (typeof parent.get_children !== "undefined") {
        parent.get_children().forEach(function(child) {
            reorientArrows(child, from, to);
        });
    }
