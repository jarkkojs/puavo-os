Here is a Puavo-implementation for installing Nextcloud on a bootserver.
The "puavo-docker" script manages Docker and other scripts help with
Nextcloud configuration.

This work was inspired by the Nextcloud configuration
of the FUSS project (see https://fuss.bz.it/ and
https://gitlab.fuss.bz.it/fuss-team/fuss-nc).
Their presentation "Empowering the school of the future" can be seen
at https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/fuss_remote_access/ .
If you are looking for possible ways to automatically setup Nextcloud
with LDAP and Samba, you may also want to look up their implementation
for ideas.
