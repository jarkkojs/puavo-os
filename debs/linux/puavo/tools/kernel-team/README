Changelog practice :

  When making a change in a package, without having it uploaded,
  please put the changelog entry to UNRELEASED instead of unstable.
  When doing the upload, this UNRELEASED tag has to be changed back
  to unstable.  Additionally, the trailer line should be updated (the
  line containing the name of the person doing the upload and the
  date). But then, dch takes care of this for you :)
