  The GNU General Public License (GPL)
  .
  Version 2, June 1991
  .
  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
  .
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.
  .
  Preamble
  .
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
  software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
  most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
  authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
  covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  .
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
  can do these things.
  .
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
  you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
  translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
  software, or if you modify it.
  .
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
  a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
  make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
  show them these terms so they know their rights.
  .
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
  offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
  and/or modify the software.
  .
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
  everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
  software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
  know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
  by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
  .
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
  wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
  individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
  everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  .
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.
  .
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  .
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
  placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
  or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
  Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
  without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
  "you".
  .
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
  this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
  not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
  running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  .
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
  you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
  and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
  Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
  .
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
  at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  .
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
  forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
  or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
  these conditions:
  .
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  .
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
      this License.
  .
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
      you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
      most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
      of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
      not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
      not required to print an announcement.)
  .
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
  sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
  considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
  its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
  works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
  work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
  of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  .
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
  right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
  the Program.
  .
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
  Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
  License.
  .
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
  Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
  2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  .
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  .
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  .
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)
  .
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
  the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
  of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
  distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
  source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
  of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  .
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
  code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
  third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  .
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
  expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
  rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  .
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
  or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
  accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
  any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
  do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  .
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
  copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
  rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
  third parties to this License.
  .
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
  are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
  contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
  conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
  of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
  you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  .
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
  the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  .
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
  distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
  choice.
  .
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
  consequence of the rest of this License.
  .
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
  copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
  such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
  of this License.
  .
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
  General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
  or concerns.
  .
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
  version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
  that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
  choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  .
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
  whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
  permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
  all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
  software generally.
  .
  NO WARRANTY
  .
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
  THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
  PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
  PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
  YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  .
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
  PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
  INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
  BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
  OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  .
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  .
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  .
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
  use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
  which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  .
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
  them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
  of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
  pointer to where the full notice is found.
  .
      One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
  .
      Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
  .
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
      under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
      Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
      any later version.
  .
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
      ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
      more details.
  .
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
      with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
  .
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  .
  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
  starts in an interactive mode:
  .
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
      with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
      software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
      type 'show c' for details.
  .
  The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
  called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
  .
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
  is a sample; alter the names:
  .
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
  .
      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
  .
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
  .
  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
  License instead of this License.
  .
  .
  "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
  .
  Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
  subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
  only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
  the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
  exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
  .
      Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
      a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
      the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
  .
      As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
      permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
      executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
      and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
      choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
      the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
      module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
      you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
      the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
      so, delete this exception statement from your version.

  .
  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license:
  .
  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
      modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
      Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

      for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
      Contributions or its Contributor Version.
  .
  2.2. Effective Date
  .
  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.
  .
  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
  .
  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:
  .
  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
      or
  .
  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or
  .
  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      its Contributions.
  .
  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
  the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
  .
  2.4. Subsequent Licenses
  .
  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
  License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
  permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
  .
  2.5. Representation
  .
  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
  to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
  .
  2.6. Fair Use
  .
  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.
  .
  2.7. Conditions
  .
  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.
  .
  3. Responsibilities
  -------------------
  .
  3.1. Distribution of Source Form
  .
  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
  the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
  Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
  License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
  attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
  Form.
  .
  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
  .
  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
  .
  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
      Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
      than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
  .
  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
      the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
  .
  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
  .
  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
  the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
  Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
  Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
  License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
  under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
  the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
  Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
  License(s).
  .
  3.4. Notices
  .
  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
  or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
  the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
  .
  3.5. Application of Additional Terms
  .
  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
  such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.
  .
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
  ---------------------------------------------------
  .
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
  the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
  be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
  Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
  or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
  .
  5. Termination
  --------------
  .
  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
  notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
  first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
  Your receipt of the notice.
  .
  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
  counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
  You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
  2.1 of this License shall terminate.
  .
  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.
  .

  *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
  *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
  *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
  *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
  *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
  *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
  *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
  *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
  *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
  *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
  *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
  *                                                                      *

  *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
  *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
  *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

  *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
  *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
  *  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

  *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
  *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

  *                                                                      *
  ************************************************************************
  .
  8. Litigation
  -------------
  .
  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
  place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
  cross-claims or counter-claims.
  .
  9. Miscellaneous
  ----------------
  .
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
  that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
  shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
  .
  10. Versions of the License
  ---------------------------
  .
  10.1. New Versions
  .
  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

  distinguishing version number.
  .
  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  10.3. Modified Versions
  .
  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
  any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
  such modified license differs from this License).
  .
  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses
  .
  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

  Statement of Purpose
  .
  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
  exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
  subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
  authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
  .
  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
  purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
  works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
  claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
  and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
  purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
  contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
  further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
  reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
  efforts of others.
  .
  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
  of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
  Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
  and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
  and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
  Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
  effect of CC0 on those rights.
  .
  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
  protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
  Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
  to, the following:
  .
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;
  .
    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  .
    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;
  .
    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  .
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
    a Work;
  .
    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
  .
    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
  .
  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
  applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
  unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
  and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
  known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
  action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
  duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
  extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
  copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
  commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
  the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
  detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
  shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
  any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
  by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
  .
  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
  judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
  shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
  Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
  is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
  non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
  unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
  the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
  provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
  purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
  promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
  of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
  License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
  applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
  invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
  affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
  Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
  and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
  Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
  .
  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
  .
    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  .
    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
    of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
    other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  .
    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
    any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
    or other rights required for any use of the Work.
  .
    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
    CC0 or use of the Work.

  FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one
  which fits your needs best.
  .
      The FreeType License (FTL) is the most commonly used one. It is
      a BSD-style license with a credit clause and thus compatible with
      the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, but not with the
      GPL version 2.
  .
      The GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Use it for all
      projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license
      compatible to the GPLv2.

  Introduction
  ============
  .
    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.
  .
    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
  .
    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
  .
      o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
  .
      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
  .
      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        FreeType code. (`credits')
  .
    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
  .
  .
    Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:
  .
     """
      Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
      Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
     """
  .
    Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.
  .
  .
  Legal Terms
  ===========
  .
  0. Definitions
  --------------
  .
    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.
  .
    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.
  .
    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.
  .
    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.
  .
  1. No Warranty
  --------------
  .
    THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
  .
  2. Redistribution
  -----------------
  .
    This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:
  .
      o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
        (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
        the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
        documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
        original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
        files.
  .
      o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
        states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
        FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
        encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
        documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
  .
    These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.
  .
  3. Advertising
  --------------
  .
    Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.
  .
    We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
  .
    As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
    of this license.
  .
  4. Contacts

  This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
  2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this
  license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects
  that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific
  dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use".
  Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so
  as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility
  and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our
  Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site,
  including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and

                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                         Version 2.1, February 1999
  .
   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  .
  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
   as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
   the version number 2.1.]
  .
                              Preamble
  .
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  .
    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
  .
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.
  .
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  .
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  .
    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  .
    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  .
    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  .
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.
  .
    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.
  .
    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.
  .
    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
  .
    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.
  .
    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.
  .
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  .
                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  .
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  .
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  .
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  .
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.
  .
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.
  .
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.
  .
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  .
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  .
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  .
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  .
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  .
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.
  .
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
      root function must still compute square roots.)
  .
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  .
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.
  .
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  .
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  .
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  .
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.
  .
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.
  .
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  .
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  .
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  .
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  .
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  .
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  .
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.
  .
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
  of these things:
  .
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
      to use the modified definitions.)
  .
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
  .
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
      least three years, to give the same user the materials
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
      than the cost of performing this distribution.
  .
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.
  .
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  .
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.
  .
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  .
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
  .
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
      Sections above.
  .
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  .
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  .
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.
  .
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  .
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
  .
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  .
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  .
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  .
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.
  .
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  .
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  .
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.
  .
                              NO WARRANTY
  .
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  .
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
  .
                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  .
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).
  .
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  .
