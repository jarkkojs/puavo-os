DANGER, WILL ROBINSON!  DANGER!

THIS PROCEDURE WILL DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY!

This utility tries to quickly reset laptop state to something as if
it came from "the factory", as if nobody had ever used it.  This will
DESTROY YOUR STUFF and home directory contents, though in a quick way so
that old files MAY still recoverable with suitable tools.  If possible,
you should consider erasing things in a more secure way by doing a
reinstall with a full disk device "wipe".  That option is not perfect
either, but much better than this quick-and-dirty procedure.

DANGER!
THIS PROCEDURE WILL DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY, AND MORE!
WHEN IN DOUBT, TURN OFF THE MACHINE, PANIC AND RUN AWAY!
